# azure-storage-insights-workbook-template

Storage insights provides comprehensive monitoring of your Azure Storage accounts by delivering a unified view of your Azure Storage services performance, capacity, and availability. You can observe storage capacity, and performance in two ways, view directly from a storage account or view from Azure Monitor to see across groups of storage accounts. 

## What it Delivers?

- **At scale perspective** showing a snapshot view of their availability based on the health of the storage service or the API operation, utilization showing total number of requests that the storage service receives, and latency showing the average time the storage service or API operation type is taking to process requests. You can also view capacity by blob, file, table, and queue.

- **Drill down analysis** of a particular storage account to help diagnose issues or perform detailed analysis by category - availability, performance, failures, and capacity. Selecting any one of those options provides an in-depth view of metrics.

- **Customizable** where you can change which metrics you want to see, modify or set thresholds that align with your limits, and save as your own workbook. Charts in the workbook can be pinned to Azure dashboard.

## What is new and improved?
We have enhanced the capability of Storage insights by updating the default workbook to give more visual information related to detailed subscription/resource group information of storage account, blob information on count, capacity and backup, fileshare capacity utilisation at sorage level and DfS cost estimation to help monitor and optimize our storage resources effectively. This asset aims to provides workbook template as a valuable tool which can be intergrated in any environment, designed to provide a detailed overview of Azure Storage Accounts.
